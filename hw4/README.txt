Keegan Nave - CS 325

First please compile the program with these commands:
	1.) g++ -std=c++11 activity.cpp -o activity


Please be aware that my program is counting on the fact that the data file is named act.txt.

Next run the program for grading 

	-  ./activity 	(runs activity will output solution to terminal)

Thanks for your time!
