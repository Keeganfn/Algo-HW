First please compile the program with these commands:
	1.) g++ -std=c++11 rivals.cpp -o rivals


Please be aware that my program is counting on the fact that the input file will formatted like the examples and be provided via the command line argument. Only one file can be read at a time

Next run the program for grading 

	-  ./rivals wrestler.txt 	(runs rivals with wrestler.txt input file output solution to terminal, replace wrestler.txt with any txt file)

Thanks for your time!
