First please compile the program with these commands:
	1.) g++ stoogesort.cpp -o stoogesort


Please be aware that my program are counting on the fact that the data file is named data.txt.

Next run the program for grading 

	-  ./stoogesort 	(runs stoogesort will create stooge.out)

Thanks for your time!
