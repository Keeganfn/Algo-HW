Keegan Nave - CS 325

First please compile the programs with these commands:
	1.) g++ -std=c++11 insertsort.cpp -o insertsort
	2.) g++ -std=c++11 mergesort.cpp -o mergesort
	3.) g++ -std=c++11 insertTime.cpp -o insertTime
	4.) g++ -std=c++11 mergeTime.cpp -o mergeTime


Please be aware that my programs are counting on the fact that the data file is named data.txt.

Next run the programs we just compiled in whatever order you would like for grading (insertsort and mergesort will output insert.out and merge.out respectively):

	-  ./insertsort 	(runs insertsort will create insert.out)
	-  ./mergesort 		(runs mergesort will create merge.out)
	-  ./insertTime 	(runs insertTime will output time taken to sort)
	-  ./mergeTime 		(runs mergeTime will output time taken to sort)


Thanks for your time!
